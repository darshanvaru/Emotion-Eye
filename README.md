# Emotion-Eye

## Introduction

Emotion-Eye is an advanced facial emotion recognition project that leverages computer vision and machine learning techniques to detect and classify human emotions from images or video streams. It is designed to provide real-time emotion analysis using deep learning models, making it suitable for applications in human-computer interaction, surveillance, and user experience research.

## Requirements

To run Emotion-Eye smoothly, ensure you have the following dependencies and system requirements:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (as required by the model)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- dlib (for face detection, if used)
- Pre-trained model weights (provided or referenced in the repository)
- GPU (recommended for faster inference)

You can install the dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Features

Emotion-Eye comes equipped with a variety of features:

- Real-time emotion detection from webcam or video files
- Static image emotion analysis
- Support for multiple emotion classes (e.g., happy, sad, angry, surprised, neutral)
- Visualization of detected emotions with bounding boxes and labels
- Modular codebase for easy customization and extension
- Batch processing for large datasets
- Command-line interface for quick operation
